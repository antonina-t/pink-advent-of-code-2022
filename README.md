# Pink Advent of Code 2022
Let's save Christmas!

Welcome to the Pink workshop on Dec, 4th in Malm√∂! We will be solving problems from [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/) in Java!

### Setup

1. The editor I will be using is IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. Make sure you have it: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)

2. Download the code, e.g. by running `git clone https://github.com/antonina-t/pink-advent-of-code-2022.git` in the terminal

3. Open the project in IntelliJ. You might have to download a JDK. I am using openjdk-19

4. Look at the files in our project: 
   * The `input` folder contains the input files (only our test input for Day 0 for now)
   * `Day0` has the solution to _Day 0 - Practice task_ below
   * `Reader` is a helper file to read from input files
   * `Runner` is the main program running solutions for different days

5. Try to run the code that solves _Day 0_ by running the `Runner` file

#### _Day 0 - Practice task_

_Imagine you have a list of numbers and you need to find their sum. And then their product. Go!_

Enjoy and see you soon :)
